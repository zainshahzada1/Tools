I would like to share my recent project where I created microservices APIs using the Django Rest Framework. These APIs include a range of functionalities such as a YouTube video downloader, a YouTube playlist downloader, an audio downloader for YouTube videos, a word-to-pdf converter, an image-to-pdf converter, a pdf-to-image converter, and a versatile API that can perform image format conversions, image cropping, and image merging.

The process is simple: users can send a file along with the desired format to which they want to convert the file as a post request. The API then responds by sending back the converted file. Moreover, users who need to download a YouTube video or playlist, or an mp3 file, can simply provide the link to the video or playlist, and the API will download the required material as per the user's request.

I hope this brief summary of my project showcases the versatility and functionality of the microservices APIs that I have developed using the Django Rest Framework.
